# 42-piscine

The highlight of our selection process is the Piscine. The Piscine (from the French word for "swimming pool") is the last phase before full admission to the 42 Ecole program. It's 4 weeks long, designed to gear you up to learn the basics of programming with peers like you. The Piscine is a chance for you to discover your passion for learning software development in the context of the collaborative culture 42 Ecole fosters. It's a chance for you to learn programming from scratch or dive deeper into your skillset and find out whether 42 Ecole is a good fit for you.
